This Web Component allows you to have a **search engine** similar to **Vitepress** easily in any framework _(React, Brisa, Vue, Solid.js, Svelte, Vanilla JS, etc)_.

Includes:

- [**MiniSearch**](https://lucaong.github.io/minisearch/)
- [**Mark.js**](https://markjs.io/)
- [**Signals**](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals)
- [**Declarative Shadow DOM**](https://web.dev/articles/declarative-shadow-dom) (You can do SSR of it without problems)

## [ðŸ”— Demo](https://search-engine-wc.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

### In any framework except Brisa

Add these scripts into your `<head>`:

```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "brisa/client": "https://unpkg.com/brisa@latest/client-simplified/index.js"
    }
  }
</script>
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/search-engine-wc@latest"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install search-engine-wc
```

And then import it in your code:

```js
import "search-engine-wc";
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> You need to add the `importmap` for `brisa/client`. All the web components made with Brisa need this wrapper to run, the good thing is that if you have other WC made with Brisa you won't need again to add the 3kb that `brisa/client` occupies.

#### SSR

**Pre-requisites**: You need to have [Brisa](https://brisa.build) installed.

For SSR you can use the `renderToString` function from `brisa/server`:

```tsx
import { renderToString } from "brisa/server";
import { jsx } from "brisa/jsx-runtime";
import SearchEngineWC from "search-engine-wc/server";

const jsonUrl = "/demo.json";
const htmlString = await renderToString(jsx(SearchEngineWC, { jsonUrl }));
```

### In Brisa Framework

First install:

```bash
bun add search-engine-wc --save --exact
```

Then import it in your `src/web-components/_integrations.ts` file:

```ts
import type { WebComponentIntegrations } from "brisa";

export default {
  "search-engine-wc": {
    client: "search-engine-wc",
    server: "search-engine-wc/server",
    types: "search-engine-wc/types",
  },
} satisfies WebComponentIntegrations;
```

### Usage

```html
<search-engine-wc jsonUrl="/demo.json" />
```

To work properly you have to provide a JSON with all the sections of your pages.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "/blog/introduction#what-is-this-blog",
    "title": "Introduction",
    "text": "Welcome to the blog! In this section, we explain what this blog is about...",

    "text": "Closures are a key concept in JavaScript that allow functions to access variables...",

  }
]
```

## Props

- `jsonUrl`: The URL of the JSON file with all the sections of your pages.
- `maxResults`: The maximum number of results to show. (Default: `15`)

## CSS Variables

```css
--search-engine-color: #07645a
  /* The color of the text (borders are derived colors from this) */;
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Dark mode is supported by default with the `color-scheme` css property (`light` / `dark`).

## Types

```ts
export default function SearchEngineWC(props: {
  jsonUrl: string;
  maxResults?: number;
}): JSX.Element;
```

## Notes for Contributors

Good to know:

1. The code is inside `src/web-components/search-engine-wc.tsx`, the other files from `src` is for the demo.
2. `bun run build` do the build of both (demo + web component).
3. `bun dev` you can preview the WC inside the demo on https://localhost:3000.
